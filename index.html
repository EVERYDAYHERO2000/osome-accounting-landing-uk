                <div class="qa__i"> 
                  <div class="qa__title">Why outsource corporate secretarial services?</div>
                  <div class="qa__description"><p>Only really big companies need an in-house Corporate Secretary – there is simply not much to do for the officer in a small one. Unless there are constant changes, the Corporate Secretary is only busy preparing for the AGM and filing the Annual Return once a year. If that is your case, outsource these services just like most of the small and medium companies in Singapore.</p></div>
                </div>
                <div class="qa__i"> 
                  <div class="qa__title">What if I already have a corporate secretary? It is probably hard to switch, right?</div>
                  <div class="qa__description"><p>At Osome, we make the transfer easy. We take over all the documents and registers from your current provider, process the necessary paperwork, and make sure the outgoing Secretary signs the papers. If the former officer doesn’t respond, we will carry out the procedure without him/her. Either way, for you the transition is seamless.</p></div>
                </div>
                <div class="qa__i"> 
                  <div class="qa__title">Do I need a Corporate Secretary?</div>
                  <div class="qa__description"><p>Yes, you do — ACRA requires every Singapore business to hire a Corporate Secretary within the first 6 months after the incorporation and later this position can’t be vacant for more than 6 months. Your Corporate Secretary has to be a Singapore resident. You can outsource this service to an agency like us.</p></div>
                </div>
                <div class="qa__i"> 
                  <div class="qa__title">Can I be a Corporate Secretary myself?</div>
                  <div class="qa__description"><p>If you’d like to. First, you need to have all the qualifications of a Corporate Secretary plus 5 years of experience. Second, you have to be a Singapore citizen, or a permanent resident, or an EntrePass holder. Finally, you can’t be both the only director and the Corporate Secretary.</p></div>
                </div>
                <div class="qa__i"> 
                  <div class="qa__title">I don’t understand what is required of my company.</div>
                  <div class="qa__description"><p>First, Corporate Secretary tracks changes in your company and reports to ACRA. Whenever you change directors, auditors, secretaries, shareholders, your share capital or the company name they send a notice. Then there are several registers they have to maintain, like the Register of Company Charges or the Register of Controllers. They are in charge of preparing and recording board minutes and annual general meetings, as well as dealing with the official correspondence and the insurance.</p></div>

                <div class="qa__i"> 
                  <div class="qa__title">What if my Corporate Secretary resigns?</div>
                  <div class="qa__description"><p>At Osome, we protect you from the hassle of changing Corporate Secretaries. You get two experts assigned to your company: one in charge and another one to back him up. If your dedicated Secretary takes a vacation, gets sick, or resigns, the second one takes over instantly and smoothly.</p></div>

                <div class="qa__i"> 
                  <div class="qa__title">Who is responsible for my papers?</div>
                  <div class="qa__description"><p>We take care of all the necessary documents: prepare standard papers for AGMs, process annual returns, support changes in your company with resolutions and update the necessary registers. We only need you to update us when the change has happened so we can start the flow and send you the documents ready for e-sign.</p></div>

                <div class="qa__i"> 
                  <div class="qa__title">Is there a risk of getting fined?</div>
                  <div class="qa__description"><p>ACRA fines companies that miss filing deadlines or make mistakes in the documents. We’ve automated standard processes to manage these risks: the AI updates deadlines and fills out forms, so you don’t have to worry about human errors.</p></div>
                </div>
                <div class="qa__i"> 
                  <div class="qa__title">What if I need a lot of documents?</div>
                  <div class="qa__description"><p>Often a business requires a lot of changes, especially if you’re just figuring out your company structure or going through a transformation period. Paying for each resolution would be costly, so we came up with a subscription plan. For S$300 a year, you can upgrade to Unlimited Corporate Secretary. This package includes all and any resolutions you might need, so no more extra charges.</p></div>

                  <div class="qa__description"><p>If you feel like your paperwork right now is out of shape, that’s ok: it’s our job to make sure everything is in order. Once you switch to Osome, we guarantee that each document gets stored in a relevant folder easy for you to retrieve and share. No more digging papers out of messy email threads or clogged databases.</p></div>

                  <div class="qa__description"><p>Osome serves all kinds of businesses registered in Singapore: private limited companies, general, limited, and limited liability partnerships. If you have a Sole Proprietorship and want to switch, we’ll help you with the process. We work with all industries, including the businesses that need licensing.</p></div>

                  <div class="qa__description"><p>Osome certified Corporate Secretaries are self-sufficient. They track deadlines and set tasks to themselves, ensuring your compliance with the law. Osome does both: produces documents and files them to the government bodies, so zero support from your staff is needed.</p></div>

Just send us a message in the chat  — we’ll prepare the documents, send them to you and you sign them electronically with a tap of your finger.</p></div>

                  <div class="qa__description"><p>The go-to option is our in-app chat. It’s faster than emails and you can ask questions on the go. You can also use the web version of the service. However, our communication does not have to be just that — we can arrange calls or meet up if that’s more convenient for you.</p></div>
